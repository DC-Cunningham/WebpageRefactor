# HORISEON webpage refactor

## A refactor of the HORISEON website to follow accessibility standards

By refactoring this website's HTML and CSS files the readability was increased. This allowed for better search engine optimisation. Improvement of the codebase also provided for long term sustainability of the webpage.

The refactor checked:

- that all links were functioning correctly,
- that the CSS was tidied up to make it more efficient,
- that CSS selectors and properties were efficiently and effectively consolidated,
- that CSS followed the semantic structure of the HTML elements.

Included with the process was the check, and restructure where necessary, of:

- the existence of semantic HTML elements,
- semantic HTML element structure being independent of styling and positioning,
- the existence of accessible alt attributes for all images,
- sequential heading attributes, a concise and descriptive title.
